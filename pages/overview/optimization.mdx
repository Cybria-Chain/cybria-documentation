## Optimization

Cybria Mainnet is designed to be EVM equivalent, which means Cybria Mainnet looks exactly like Ethereum in every way possible. One large and mostly unavoidable discrepancy between Cybria Mainnet and Ethereum is a slight difference in transaction fee models. This difference means that there are some opportunities to optimize Cybria Mainnet contracts to better take advantage of the Cybria Mainnet fee model.

⚠️ Contract optimizations are powerful but can also create additional contract complexity. Some types of optimizations may also become unnecessary as OP Mainnet evolves. Make sure to read through all of the considerations on this page before committing to any optimizations.
